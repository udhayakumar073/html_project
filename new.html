    <p>Optimus Prime’s leadership style is a blend of compassion, strategic vision, and strong ethical principles, embodying qualities that are essential for effective leadership in any context. His character serves not just as entertainment but as a valuable embodiment of leadership teachings we can apply in our lives.Optimus Prime knows that he can not directly handle every key project in his group and as such, he knows he must delegate some things to his team members. He gives the authority and the power to accomplish a given task and trust them to know what they need to do and how it must be done. The micromanagement is highly avoided here for betterment of the team members. He doesn’t baby sit them.</p><hr>
